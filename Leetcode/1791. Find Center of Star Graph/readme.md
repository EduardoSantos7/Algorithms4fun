# Algorithm Idea

As we know every node goes to the center and there are at least 3 nodes we only need to check those firsts nodes and fine the most frequent. Also we can just check the first two element assuming data is always in correct form.

# Complexity

- Time: O(1) - We only traverse 3 items

- Space:O(1) - We only save 3 pairs

# Results

Python)

- Runtime: 780 ms, faster than 89.39% of Python3 online submissions for Find Center of Star Graph.

- Memory Usage: 50.1 MB, less than 93.91% of Python3 online submissions for Find Center of Star Graph.
