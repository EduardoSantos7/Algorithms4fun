# Algorithm Idea

Algorithm 1) Recursion, simplest but not the fastest or small memory usgae

Use recursion to reach the end of the list and keep a pointer to head, when you reach the end start to compare the current node versus your head tempooral counterif it's different keep returning false else keep comparing.

# Complexity

- Time: O(n)

- Space:O(n)
