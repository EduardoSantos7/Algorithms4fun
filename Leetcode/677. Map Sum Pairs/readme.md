# Algorithm Idea

Build a Trie, and save in each node the sum which is updated keeping a map of key-values for previous values.

# Complexity

- Time: Insertion: O(K) where K is the length of the key, Sum: O(k)

- Space: O(N) The length of all the keys

# Results

Python)

- Runtime: 28 ms, faster than 89.46% of Python3 online submissions for Map Sum Pairs.

- Memory Usage: 14.3 MB, less than 54.53% of Python3 online submissions for Map Sum Pairs.
