# Algorithm Idea

Approach 1)

Use a dictionary to count the number of vowels per each vowel for each half of the string and then return true if the sum of the total vowels are the same for both side of the string.

Approach 2)

Use a counter to return the total number of vowels in each half and then return if those values are the same.

# Complexity
