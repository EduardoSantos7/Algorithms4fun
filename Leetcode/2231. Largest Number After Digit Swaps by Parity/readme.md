# Algorithm Idea

Remember in which position there is an even or and odd by creating an array where 0 is for even and 1 is for odd
Sort the digits
Separate the digits by parity
Iterate through the memory of parity and depending on the current position if it was even/odd bring the biggest one from the digits in that category to this position.
