# Algorithm Idea

Implement a Trie

# Complexity

- Time: (K) - where K is the length of the key. (Insertion, search, startwith)

- Space:O(N) - Length of the keys

# Results

Python)

- Runtime: 180 ms, faster than 64.26% of Python3 online submissions for Implement Trie (Prefix Tree).

- Memory Usage: 31.7 MB, less than 58.36% of Python3 online submissions for Implement Trie (Prefix Tree).
