# Algorithm Idea

Approach 1)

Brute force, for every position check if a sorted array is possible

Approach 2)

A sorted and then rotated array can only have 1 or zero drops, iterate the array to count the number of drops and count.

# Complexity

Approach 1)

- Time: O(N^2)

- Space:O(1)

Approach 2)

- Time: O(N)

- Space:O(1)
