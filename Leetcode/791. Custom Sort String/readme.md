# Algorithm Idea

Count the letters in str, traverse the order string and ask if the char is in the mem if so then add it the times it appears. The elems in the str not in order can be append in the end

# Complexity

- Time: O(N)

- Space:O(N)

# Results

- Runtime: 28 ms, faster than 85.70% of Python3 online submissions for Custom Sort String.

- Memory Usage: 14.4 MB, less than 19.70% of Python3 online submissions for Custom Sort String.
