# Algorithm Idea

Convert the number in a string
Create an array to store the characters (in case modifications of the strings are o(n) in the language used)
iterate every character and if it's 6 insert a 9 and all the next characters in the res array.
else just append the number
return the join of all of this characters casted to int

# Complexity

- Time: O(n)

- Space:O(n) or O(1) depending on implementation and how the language handle strings
