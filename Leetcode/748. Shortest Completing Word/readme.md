# Algorithm Idea

Create a dictionary  frequencies of only the alphabet characters of the string input

for each word in the dictionary do the same cleaning and come if all the characters from the input string are in that word in at least the same amount.

if that's the case check if the length of that word is smaller or the first we see and store it.

# Complexity

- Time: O(w*c) where w is the number of words as input and c is the average number of characters in a word

- Space:O(w)
