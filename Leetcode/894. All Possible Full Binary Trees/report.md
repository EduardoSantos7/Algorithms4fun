# Algorithm Idea

Build each tree using the constructed subtrees that are binary trees too.


# Complexity

- Time: O(2^N)

- Space:O(2^N)

# Results

- Runtime: 188 ms, faster than 98.87% of Python3 online submissions for All Possible Full Binary Trees. 

- Memory Usage: 16.3 MB, less than 96.99% of Python3 online submissions for All Possible Full Binary Trees.
