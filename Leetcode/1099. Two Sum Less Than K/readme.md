# Algorithm Idea

Approach 1)

Use the information that the max number is 1000 to have an array of counts.

Approach 2)

Brute force

Approach 3)

Two Pointer + Sort

# Complexity

Approach 1)

- Time: O(N)

- Space:O(1)

Approach 2)

- Time: O(N^2)

- Space:O(1)

Approach 3)

- Time: O(NLogN)

- Space:O(N)
