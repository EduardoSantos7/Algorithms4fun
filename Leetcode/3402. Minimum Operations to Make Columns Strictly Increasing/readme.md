# Algorithm Idea

Matrix iteration, the difference in the approach is how to traverse the matrix, if horizontally then it's more intuitive but have to overwrite the matrix. If vertically, then less write operations.

# Complexity

Approach 1)

- Time: O(NxM)

- Space:O(1)

Approach 2)

- Time: O(NxM)

- Space:O(1)

# Results

Approach 2)
