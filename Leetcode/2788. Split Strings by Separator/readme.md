# Algorithm Idea

Iterate each word and split it by separator en remove the empty one, add the new words into a list and after iterate all of them return that list with all the results.

# Complexity

- Time: O(w*n) where w is the number of words and n is the average length of words

- Space:O(n)

# Results
