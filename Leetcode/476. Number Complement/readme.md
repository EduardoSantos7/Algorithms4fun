# Algorithm Idea

Create a mask for the given number and use xor to do the complement.

# Complexity

- Time: O(n) -> where n is the number of bits in the number, as 31 is the max number of bits in the number, it could be consider a constant time

- Space:O(1)

# Results

Rust)

- Runtime: 0 ms, faster than 100.00% of Rust online submissions for Number Complement.

- Memory Usage: 2 MB, less than 66.67% of Rust online submissions for Number Complement.
