# Algorithm Idea

Approach 1)

Convert numbers to binary strings: The integers start and goal are first converted into their binary representation. This is done using Python's built-in function bin(), although here it's formatted as f'{number:b}' which directly provides a binary string without the '0b' prefix.
Zero padding to equal length: The binary strings are then padded with zeros on the left to make their lengths equal. This is necessary because, for instance, the binary representation of 3 is '11' and for 8 is '1000'. To compare these bit by bit, they should be of the same length, so '11' becomes '0011'.
Count differing bits: The algorithm then iterates over each bit of the two padded binary strings. It compares corresponding bits in the same positions; if they differ (one is '1' and the other is '0'), the count of bit flips is incremented.
Return the count: After checking all bits, the total count of differing bits is returned, which represents the number of bit flips required to transform start to goal.

Approach 2)

Bitwise XOR: This algorithm utilizes a more straightforward approach by employing the bitwise XOR operation (^). XOR outputs '1' for any bit position where the corresponding bits of start and goal are different and '0' where they are the same.
Count set bits: The result of the XOR operation is then used with .bit_count(), which counts the number of '1's in the binary representation of the XOR result. This count directly represents the number of bit positions where start and goal differ and, thus, the number of flips needed.


# Complexity

Approach 1)

- Time: O(n) where n is the number of bits of the number

- Space:O(1)

Approach 2)

- Time: O(1) because there is a limit in the number of bits

- Space:O(1)
