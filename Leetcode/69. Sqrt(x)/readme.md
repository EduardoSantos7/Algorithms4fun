# Algorithm Idea

Using Binary Search we can approximate a int number, we return when th number multiplyed by itself is x or when it's the same as the low range.

# Complexity

- Time: O(log N)

- Space:O(1)

# Results

- Runtime: 32 ms, faster than 88.52% of Python3 online submissions for Sqrt(x).

- Memory Usage: 14.3 MB, less than 7.24% of Python3 online submissions for Sqrt(x).
