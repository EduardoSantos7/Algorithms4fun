# Algorithm Idea

Use 2 pointers to check for continuos patterns. The second pointer should be M steps ahead.

# Complexity

- Time: O(N)

- Space:O(1)

# Results

Python)

- Runtime: 32 ms, faster than 100.00% of Python3 online submissions for Detect Pattern of Length M Repeated K or More Times.

- Memory Usage: 14 MB, less than 25.00% of Python3 online submissions for Detect Pattern of Length M Repeated K or More Times.
