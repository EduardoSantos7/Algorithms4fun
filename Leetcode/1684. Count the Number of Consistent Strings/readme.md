# Algorithm Idea

Transform the allowed string into a set and iterate over the words, each word is transform to a set if the substraction is 0 (all the element of the word are allowed) then increment the counter.

# Complexity

- Time: O(n^2)

- Space:O(n) - space used to create the set for each word

# Results

Python)

- Runtime: 256 ms, faster than 58.70% of Python3 online submissions for Count the Number of Consistent Strings.

- Memory Usage: 16.3 MB, less than 6.12% of Python3 online submissions for Count the Number of Consistent Strings.
