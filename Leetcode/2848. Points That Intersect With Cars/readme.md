# Algorithm Idea

Create a set to keep the integers that are covered
Iterate the list of coordinates in the input and update the set with the list of numbers generated from the range of coordinates[0] to coordinates[1] inclusive
Return the length of the set

# Complexity

- Time: O(n)

- Space:O(n)
