# Algorithm Idea

Create an array of length n+1 to store the values. Create a integer variable to keep the index from what should be out. For every insertion save the value in the stream and then do a loop incrementing the pointer if the current value is not None, then return a subset of the stream from the idKey passed as parameter to the current value of the pointer.
