# Algorithm Idea

The sumCounts function takes a vector of integers nums as input and calculates the sum of the squares of the sizes of all possible distinct subsequences. It uses a map named mp to store unique elements within each subarray. The function iterates over all subarrays of the input array using two nested loops. The outer loop specifies the starting index i, and the inner loop specifies the ending index j.
