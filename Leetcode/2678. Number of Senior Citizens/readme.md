# Algorithm Idea

Iterate the strings and cast to int the indexes 11 and 12, and if it's bigger than 60 increase a counter

# Complexity

- Time: O(n)

- Space:O(1) // Implementation in python could be n if a new list with the filtered results is generated, but this can be implemented in O(1)

# Results
