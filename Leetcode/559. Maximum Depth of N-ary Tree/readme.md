# Algorithm Idea

Traverse the tree using recursive DFS and pass a counter incremented by 1 in each call.

# Complexity

- Time: O(n)

- Space:O(d) - which d is the longest depth due to use of the stack

# Results

Python)

- Runtime: 36 ms, faster than 98.74% of Python3 online submissions for Maximum Depth of N-ary Tree.

- Memory Usage: 16 MB, less than 49.95% of Python3 online submissions for Maximum Depth of N-ary Tree.
