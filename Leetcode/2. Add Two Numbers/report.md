# Algorithm Idea
Traverse each list at the same time, calculate the sum and change tthe carry value if need it.

# Complexity
Time: O(max(n, m)) where n and m represent the length of L1 and L2
Space:O(1)

# Results
Runtime: 68 ms, faster than 85.62% of Python3 online submissions for Add Two Numbers.
Memory Usage: 12.7 MB, less than 100.00% of Python3 online submissions for Add Two Numbers.
