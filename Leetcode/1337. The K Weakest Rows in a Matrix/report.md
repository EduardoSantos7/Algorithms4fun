# Algorithm Idea

Traverse each row to count the ones (this count could be perfom using binary search or linear count) after this sort the array base on weakness and return the firsk k items.

# Complexity

- Time: O(N ^ 2) or O(N ^ Log N) # Depending of how the count is implemented

- Space:O(N)

# Results

Python)

    - Runtime: 104 ms, faster than 95.81% of Python3 online submissions for The K Weakest Rows in a Matrix.

    - Memory Usage: 13.9 MB, less than 100.00% of Python3 online submissions for The K Weakest Rows in a Matrix.
