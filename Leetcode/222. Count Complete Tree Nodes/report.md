# Algorithm Idea

Use the property of complete trees no avoid compute left tree when right is complete.

# Complexity

- Time: O(log(N))

- Space:O(1)

# Results

Python)

- Runtime: 76 ms, faster than 74.78% of Python3 online submissions for Count Complete Tree Nodes.

- Memory Usage: 21.3 MB, less than 68.01% of Python3 online submissions for Count Complete Tree Nodes.
