# Algorithm Idea

Algorithm 1)

Traverse the string and start to count after each space or keep a previous result.

Algorithm 2)

Split the string by space and take the last one and return the length.

Algorithm 3)

Traverse the string to the last char. Go back until count the last word. (Valid in languuages like C where string are indexable or pointer arithmetic is allowed)

# Complexity

Algorithm 1)

- Time: O(N)

- Space:O(1)

Algorithm 2)

- Time: O(N)

- Space:O(W) where W is the number of words

Algorithm 3)

- Time: O(N)

- Space:O(1)
