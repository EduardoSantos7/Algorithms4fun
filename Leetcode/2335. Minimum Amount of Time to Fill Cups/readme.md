# Algorithm Idea

Sort the numbers
If the largest amount is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two. Otherwise, the answer is the ceiling of total_cups / 2

# Complexity

Approach 1)

- Time: O(D) where D is total_sum // 2

- Space:O(1)
  
Approach 2)

- Time: O(1) but since N is fixed to 3 then it's O(1)

- Space:O(1)
