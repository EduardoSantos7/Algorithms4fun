# Algorithm Idea

Create a dictionary to store the frequency of numbers, traverse the list and for each number get the 2 numbers it could need to create k, look for those numbers in the dictionary and sum up their values to a counter which you will return at the end, after the sum update the dictionary with the current number.

# Complexity

- Time: O(n)
