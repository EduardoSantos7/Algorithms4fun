# Algorithm Idea

Use 2 pointers to swap nodes and move each pointer 2 steps forward, if the right pointer will point to a valid node then update its next to that element if not keep the same next. Repeat while there is a right node.

# Complexity

- Time: O(N)

- Space:O(1)

# Results

- Python)

- Runtime: 28 ms, faster than 85.66% of Python3 online submissions for Swap Nodes in Pairs.
- Memory Usage: 14.2 MB, less than 77.43% of Python3 online submissions for Swap Nodes in Pairs.
