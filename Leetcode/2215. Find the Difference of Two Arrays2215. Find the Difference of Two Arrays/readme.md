# Algorithm Idea

Make 2 sets using the two input arrays.
return an array where the first element is the diference betweens s1 and s2 and the second element is the difference between s2 and s1

# Complexity

- Time: O(n) because takes n to convert the list to a set

- Space:O(n) bacause takes n to store the elements in the new set

# Results
