# Algorithm Idea

Transform the integer in its binary representation
Iterate the binary number, if the current position is a 1 start a counter to the next one and compare the length with a global maximum

# Complexity

- Time: O(n)

- Space:O(1) considering the binary transformation as constant since input is known from the start: 1 <= n <= 109

# Results
