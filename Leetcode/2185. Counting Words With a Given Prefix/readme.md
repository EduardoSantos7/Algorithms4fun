# Algorithm Idea

Iterate every word in the array, check the first c characters of the string where c is the length of the prefix, if those are equals to the prefix, increase a counter. 

# Complexity

- Time: O(c*n) = O(n) where n is the number of words and c is the size of the prefix which is constant

- Space:O()

# Results
