# Algorithm Idea
Initialize Data Structures:

Create a dictionary (or hashmap) called dp to cache the sum of digits for each number. Initialize this dictionary with {0: 0} to handle the base case where the digit sum of 0 is 0.
Create a list (or array) called counts with enough elements to cover all possible digit sums. The size should be at least 
4
√ó
9
4√ó9 (36) if considering up to four-digit numbers. Initialize all elements to 0.
Calculate Digit Sums Using Dynamic Programming:

Iterate through each number from 1 to 
ùëõ
n using a loop.
For each number, use a method (like divmod in Python) to separate the last digit from the rest of the number. This can be achieved by dividing the number by 10:
The remainder is the last digit.
The quotient is the rest of the number.
Compute the digit sum for the current number by adding the last digit to the digit sum of the quotient, which should be retrieved from the dp cache.
Update the dp dictionary to include this new number and its digit sum.
Count Occurrences of Each Digit Sum:

For each number, after calculating its digit sum, increment the corresponding index in the counts list. Since list indices are zero-based, use the digit sum minus one as the index to update.
Determine the Maximum Group Size:

After populating the counts list, find the maximum value in the list, which represents the size of the largest group(s).
Count How Many Groups Have the Maximum Size:

Count how many times the maximum group size appears in the counts list. This tells you how many different digit sums resulted in the maximum group size.
Return the Result:

The final step is to return the count of groups that have the largest size, which corresponds to the number of times the maximum value appeared in the counts list.
