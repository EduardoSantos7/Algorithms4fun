# Algorithm Idea
Keep track of the characters and indexes saw, in this way we can avoid to traverse again the list when we find a duplicate.

# Complexity
Time: O(n)
Space:O(min(n, m)) where n is the length of the string and m is the resulting length.

# Results
Runtime: 52 ms, faster than 93.58% of Python3 online submissions for Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters.
Memory Usage: 12.9 MB, less than 99.49% of Python3 online submissions for Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters.
