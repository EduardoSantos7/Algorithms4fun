# Algorithm Idea

Create and iterate a Trie using BFS, when you find a complete word then check if this s bigger than the current answer or if it is equal check if it has a smaller lexicographical order

# Complexity

- Time: O(sum(len(w))) - The sum of the length of words

- Space:O(sum(len(w))) - The sum of the length of words

# Results

Python)

- Runtime: 140 ms, faster than 52.24% of Python3 online submissions for Longest Word in Dictionary.

- Memory Usage: 15.1 MB, less than 15.00% of Python3 online submissions for Longest Word in Dictionary.
