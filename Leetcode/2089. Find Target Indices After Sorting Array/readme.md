# Algorithm Idea

You can sort, but that will imply to increase the complexity, instead you can just count the numbers that are smaller and equal to your target and create an array with x numbers where x is the count of the numbers equals to your target, just remember to sum to each number the offset which is the smaller number count.

# Complexity

- Time: O(n)

- Space:O(n)

# Results
