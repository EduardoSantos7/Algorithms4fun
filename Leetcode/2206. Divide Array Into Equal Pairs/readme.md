# Algorithm Idea

Approach 1)

Use a hashmap to get the frequencies and then check if all the values in the map are even.

Approach 2)

Use a set to add numbers that hasn't been seen, and remove the ones seen, return if the length of the set is 0 at the end.

# Complexity

Approach 1)

- Time: O(3*n)-> O(n)
- Space:O(n)

Approach 2)

- Time: O(n)

- Space:O(n)
