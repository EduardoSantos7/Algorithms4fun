# Algorithm Idea

Approach 1)

The point where the sum of both half is equal to the sum of all is the square root. If the floor of the square root multiplied by itself is not the same as the total sum then return -1 else return the square root.

Approach 2)

Iterate the number comparing the sum of elements in both side till they are the same using n*(a+b)/2 equation. If none return -1.

# Complexity

Approach 1)

- Time: O(1)

- Space:O(1)

Approach 2)

- Time: O(n)

- Space:O(1)
