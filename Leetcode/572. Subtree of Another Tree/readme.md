# Algorithm Idea

Using recursion to verify if the current node is a subtree if the current node is not then check its children.

# Complexity

- Time: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the root tree

- Space:O(d) - the height of the tree due to recursion calls

# Results

Python)

- Runtime: 140 ms, faster than 83.41% of Python3 online submissions for Subtree of Another Tree.

- Memory Usage: 15.4 MB, less than 14.18% of Python3 online submissions for Subtree of Another Tree.
