# Algorithm Idea

Iterate the matrix, for each cell iterate from -i,-j to i+1,j+1, if the cell is valid then sum up and increase the counter of cell, then in the matrix result store the floor average

# Complexity

- Time: O(n^2) // Traverse the matrix

- Space:O(n^2) // Construct the matrix filtered

# Results
