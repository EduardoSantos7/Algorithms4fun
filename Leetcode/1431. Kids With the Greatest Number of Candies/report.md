# Algorithm Idea

Find the max value in the list, after this, iterate the list adding the extra candies number to each element and check if it's bigger than the current max, this result is saved.


# Complexity

- Time: O(N) (We are traversing the list twice, first to get the max and the second for compare)
- Space:O(N) (We are creating an extra array of size n to store the results)
