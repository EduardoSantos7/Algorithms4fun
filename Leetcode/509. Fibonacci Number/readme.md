# Algorithm Idea

Use 3 variables, the first two will be init in 0 and 1 and the third will be the sum of the previous two, compute this sum from 2 to n+1 and return this third value if n >=2 2 else return the first one if n is 0 and the second one if it's 1

# Complexity

- Time: O(n)

- Space:O(1)
