# Algorithm Idea

Traverse the array keeping memory the first element of the range, ask if the difference with the next is one, if so then keep asking when the difference is not one then is the end of the range, save it. Update the new start.

# Complexity

- Time: O(n)

- Space:O(n)

# Results

Python)

- Runtime: 28 ms, faster than 81.49% of Python3 online submissions for Summary Ranges.

- Memory Usage: 14.3 MB, less than 48.50% of Python3 online submissions for Summary Ranges.
