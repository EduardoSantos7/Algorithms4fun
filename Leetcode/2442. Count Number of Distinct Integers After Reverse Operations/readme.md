# Algorithm Idea

Per every number in the initial array make it a string, reverse it, and cast it to int again. Insert it at the end of the array. After iterate all the numbers make it a set and return the lengt

# Complexity

- Time: O(n*c) where n is the length of the array and k is the average number of characters per number in the array

- Space:O(n)

# Results
