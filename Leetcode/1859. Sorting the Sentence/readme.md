# Algorithm Idea

Split the sentence by space, create an array of length n where you will place each word according to its correct index. Concatenate the array with a space to create the correct sentence and return.

# Complexity

- Time: O(n)

- Space:O(n)

# Results

Python)

- Runtime: 24 ms, faster than 94.70% of Python3 online submissions for Sorting the Sentence.

- Memory Usage: 14 MB, less than 92.30% of Python3 online submissions for Sorting the Sentence.
