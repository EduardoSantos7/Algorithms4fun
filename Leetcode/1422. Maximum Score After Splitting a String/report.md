# Algorithm Idea

Count the ones and iterate the string till the second last character. In each iteration check wheter the char is 1 or 0 if it's 1 decrease a one if not increase the zeros and update the max comparing itself and the sum of the zeros and ones.

# Complexity

- Time: O(N)

- Space:O(1)

# Results
