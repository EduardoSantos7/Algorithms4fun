# Algorithm Idea

**Algorithm 1**

Traverse the array of bits from the right to the left, in a new variable store the current bit in tthe position: (31 - i) where i is the index of current bit (from the left).

# Complexity

- Time: O(1) - we are iterating over a constant number of bits

- Space:O(1)

# Results
