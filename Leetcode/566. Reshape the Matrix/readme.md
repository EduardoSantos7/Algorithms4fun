# Algorithm Idea

Create a method that given the num position return the number in that position in the maatrix. check if the dimensions of r*c aand thelen of the givne matrix are the same if not return the original matrix. if they are the same make a a nested loop from 0 to range r and c and in each nested iteration get the next number to be inserted and assigned in the new position. Return the new matrix.

# Complexity

- Time: O(r*c)

- Space:O(r*c)
