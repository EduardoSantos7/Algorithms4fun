# Algorithm Idea

Sort the numbers, at this point for a number in position i all the indexes smaller than i are the result for i, but in case of duplicates the value will correspond to the last element between the duplicates so we need to only add the count at the first ocurrence.

# Complexity

- Time: O(nlogn)
- Space:O(n)

# Results

- Runtime: 36 ms, faster than 99.95% of Python3 online submissions for How Many Numbers Are Smaller Than the Current Number.

- Memory Usage: 14 MB, less than 100.00% of Python3 online submissions for How Many Numbers Are Smaller Than the Current Number.
