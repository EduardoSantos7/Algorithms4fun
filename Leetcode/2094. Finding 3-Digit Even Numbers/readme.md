# Algorithm Idea

Generate a frequency map of the given digits
Generate a frequency map of the current number
Check if the number can be generated or not, if yes then add it to the list thar will be returned.

Note: If you go in order from 100 to 999 you don't have to sort the answer list, avoiding nlogn and keeping the answer in n.

# Complexity

- Time: O(n)

- Space:O(n)
