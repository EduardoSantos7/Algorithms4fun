# Algorithm Idea

Brute force: Iterate each word and get the next word from the current one and check if the first word is equal to the start and end of the second word in that case then increase a counter by 1.

Improvements: consider try to cache the results.

# Complexity

- Time: O(n^2)

- Space:O(1)
