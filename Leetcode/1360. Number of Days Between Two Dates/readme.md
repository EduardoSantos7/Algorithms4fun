# Algorithm Idea

Count the number of days from 1970 for each date and get the abs of the substraction. As improvement you can add cache to speed up.

# Complexity

Approach 1)

- Time: O(n)

- Space:O(1)

Approach 2) Using cache to speed up.

- Time: O(n)

- Space:O(n)

# Results

Python)

- Runtime: 32 ms, faster than 75.77% of Python3 online submissions for Number of Days Between Two Dates.

- Memory Usage: 14.2 MB, less than 69.44% of Python3 online submissions for Number of Days Between Two Dates.

Approach 2)

Python)

- Runtime: 24 ms, faster than 96.93% of Python3 online submissions for Number of Days Between Two Dates.

- Memory Usage: 14.3 MB, less than 39.24% of Python3 online submissions for Number of Days Between Two Dates.
