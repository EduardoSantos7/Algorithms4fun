# Algorithm Idea

Make two sets from the input arrays, init two counters in zero (a, b). For every num in the first array check if the current num is in the set of the other array, in that case increase the counter a by 1, repeat this for the second array but checking the first set and increasing the counter b. Return an array that includes a, b.
