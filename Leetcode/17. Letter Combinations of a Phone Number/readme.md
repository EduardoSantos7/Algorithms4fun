# Algorithm Idea

Use recursion to appendd the new char each iteration

# Complexity

- Time: O(n) - recursion call are n\*l where n is the digits lenght and l length of letters for a digit wich is almost constant 3-4.

- Space:O(n) - recursion call are n\*l where n is the digits lenght and l length of letters for a digit wich is almost constant 3-4.

# Results

Python)

- Runtime: 28 ms, faster than 86.06% of Python3 online submissions for Letter Combinations of a Phone Number.

- Memory Usage: 14.3 MB, less than 31.52% of Python3 online submissions for Letter Combinations of a Phone Number.
