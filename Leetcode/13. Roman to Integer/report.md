# Algorithm Idea
Traverse the string and check for the next character, if the current one changes the value of the next one then instead of adding the current value, subtract it.

# Complexity
Time: O(n)
Space:O(1)

# Results
Runtime: 40 ms, faster than 95.57% of Python3 online submissions for Roman to Integer.
Memory Usage: 12.6 MB, less than 100.00% of Python3 online submissions for Roman to Integer.
