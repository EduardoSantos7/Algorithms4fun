# Algorithm Idea

Move the left nodes to the right side, store the nodes on the right, we can do it using DFS. Another approach is to move the left side to the right to avoid use a stack.

# Complexity

Approach 1)

- Time: O(N)

- Space:O(d) - where d is the depth of the tree

Approach 2)

- Time: O(N)

- Space:O(1)
