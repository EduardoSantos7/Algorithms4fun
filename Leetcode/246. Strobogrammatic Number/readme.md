# Algorithm Idea

Approach 1)

Use a HasMap to built a rotated number and then compare with the original

Approach 2)

Use a HasMapbut instead of build a flipped number compare in place

# Complexity

Approach 1)

- Time: O(N) where N is the length of the string

- Space:O(M) where M is the characters flipped.

Approach 2)

- Time: O(N) where N is the length of the string

- Space:O(1)
