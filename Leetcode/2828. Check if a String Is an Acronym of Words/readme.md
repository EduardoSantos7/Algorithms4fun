# Algorithm Idea

Iterate the list of words to form a string with the first char of every word and then comapre if it's the same as string in the input.

# Complexity

- Time: O(n) where n is the number of words

- Space:O(n) due to the use of a list to crean a string to comapre with input

# Results
