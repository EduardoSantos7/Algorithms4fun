# Algorithm Idea

Algorithm 1) Traverse the diagonal matrix and sum up each cell, if the length of the matrix is odd then subtract the number in the middle of the diagonal

Algorithm 2) Traverse the diagonal matrix and sum up each cell, but this time check the for points then only have to iterate through half of the matrix.

# Complexity

- Time: O(n)

- Space:O(1)
