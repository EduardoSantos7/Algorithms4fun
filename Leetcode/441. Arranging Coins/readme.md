# Algorithm Idea

Approach 1)

Iterate until n and substract i from n each time if n > 0 then continue else break and return the current i.

Approach 2)

Binary Search to find the max k in the sequence of k\*(k+1)/2

Approach 3)

The above sequence can be solved without a loop.

# Complexity

Approach 1)

- Time: O(n)

- Space:O(1)

Approach 2)

- Time: O(log n)

- Space:O(1)

Approach 3)

- Time: O(1)

- Space:O(1)
