# Algorithm Idea

Algorithm 1)

Create an temporal array and store the chars in it in correct order.

Algorithm 2)

(Only if the language allow string mutation)

Createe temporal vars to store the current position and char, and swap them to the correct position.

# Complexity

Algorithm 1)

- Time: O(n)

- Space:O(1)

Algorithm 2)

- Time: O(n)

- Space:O(n)
