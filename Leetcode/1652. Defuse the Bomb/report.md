# Algorithm Idea

The main idea is to play with pointers. We will keep the count of n next numbers orr previous numbers and just update it. With this approach with decrease the complexity from n^2 to n. If the k = 0 then we will return a list of n 0.

# Complexity

- Time: O(N)

- Space:O(N)

# Results

- Runtime: 32 ms, faster than 100.00% of Python3 online submissions for Defuse the Bomb.

- Memory Usage: 14.1 MB, less than 100.00% of Python3 online submissions for Defuse the Bomb.
