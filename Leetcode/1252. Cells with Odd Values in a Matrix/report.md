# Algorithm Idea

Count the repetition of increments by row and column and finallyy traverse the matrix to know which is the sum for each cell,
if the sum is oodd increment by one the counter.


# Complexity

- Time: O(M x N)
- Space:O(M + N)

# Results

1) Python

    - Runtime: 36 ms, faster than 93.72% of Python3 online submissions for Cells with Odd Values in a Matrix.

    - Memory Usage: 13.9 MB, less than 100.00% of Python3 online submissions for Cells with Odd Values in a Matrix.

2) Go

    - Runtime: 0 ms, faster than 100.00% of Go online submissions for Cells with Odd Values in a Matrix.

    - Memory Usage: 2.5 MB, less than 100.00% of Go online submissions for Cells with Odd Values in a Matrix.
