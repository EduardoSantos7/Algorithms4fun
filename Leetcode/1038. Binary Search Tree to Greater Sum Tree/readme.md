# Algorithm Idea

Using DFS In Order we will visit the right nodes first and return the acum sum which will be 0 for the most right node this acum will change for left nodes.

# Complexity

- Time: O(N)

- Space:O(d) - Recursion allocated d calls in the stack in which d is the height of the tree.

# Results

Python)

- Runtime: 28 ms, faster than 85.68% of Python3 online submissions for Binary Search Tree to Greater Sum Tree.

- Memory Usage: 14.2 MB, less than 64.02% of Python3 online submissions for Binary Search Tree to Greater Sum Tree.
