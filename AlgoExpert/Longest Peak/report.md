# Algorithm Idea

As you iterate through the array from left to right, whenever you find a tip of a peak, expand outwards from the tip until you no longer have a peak. Given what peaks look like and how many peaks can therefore fit in an array, realize that this process results in a linear-time algorithm. Make sure to keep track of the longest peak you find as you iterate through the array.
