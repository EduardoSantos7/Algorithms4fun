# Algorithm Idea

Sort the array and iterate each number at each iteration we will use 2 pointers to compare if we have the 2 other numbers needed. Checking the difference we decide which pointer shoould we move, we actuallyy know that if we move left pointer we will have a bigger number and smaller if we move the bigger one.

# Complexity

- Time: O(N^2)

- Space:O(N)

# Results
