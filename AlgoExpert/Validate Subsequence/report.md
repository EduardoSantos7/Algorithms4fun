# Algorithm Idea

Traverse the list keeping a reference of the number in the sequence that you are looking for. Every iteration ask if the current number is the same that the reference if so then your reference should point to the next element in the sequence. When you find every element in the sequence return True. If you traverse the list without returned then return False.
