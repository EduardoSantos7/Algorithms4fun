# Algorithm Idea

The first approach build a matrix and use an equation too update and in the end return the lalst element in the matrix, the second one only keep track of 2 rows.

# Complexity

Approach 1

- Time: O(N*M)

- Space:O(N*M)

Approach 2

- Time: O(N*M)

- Space:O(min(N, M))

# Results

Python)

    Approach 1)

        - Runtime: 180 ms, faster than 77.51% of Python3 online submissions for Edit Distance.

        - Memory Usage: 19.4 MB, less than 13.53% of Python3 online submissions for Edit Distance.
    
    Approach 2)

        - Runtime: 144 ms, faster than 86.97% of Python3 online submissions for Edit Distance.

        - Memory Usage: 14 MB, less than 92.87% of Python3 online submissions for Edit Distance.
