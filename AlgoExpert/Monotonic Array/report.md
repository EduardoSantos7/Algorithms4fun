# Algorithm Idea

The first approach is to find the trend and check if this trend is equal for each pair of continous numbers. The second approach is to check if the array is non_increasing or is is_non_decreasing.

# Complexity

- Time: O(N)

- Space:O(1)

# Results

# Good Questions

- What's the effect of a continuos pairs of the same numbers?

- If the length is less than 2 which should be the output?
