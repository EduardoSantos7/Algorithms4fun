# Algorithm Idea

Traverse the list and sum each number if the current element is a list then make a recursive call passing a level/multiplier which will multiply the total sum of elements in tthe llist before to return.

# Complexity

- Time: O(N)

- Space:O(D) - Depth in the stack due to recursive calls

# Results
