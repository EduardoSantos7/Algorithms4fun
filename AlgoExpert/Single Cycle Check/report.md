# Algorithm Idea

Jump to the correct index and count how many jumps you did, you must give n jumps where n is the length of the array and no more. If you finished in the same index you started then there's a single loop, if you are in the start position before count n elements then there are more than 1 cycle.

# Complexity

- Time: O(N)

- Space:O(1)
