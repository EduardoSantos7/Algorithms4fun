# Algorithm Idea

Compute the difference between the target-current and target-current_near value and update if necessary, if the number is not equal then choose one tree side using BST property.

# Complexity

- Time:

  - Recursive & Iterative Approach:

    - Average: O(Log(N))

    - Worst: O(N)

- Space:

  - Recursive Approach:

    - Average: O(Log(N))

    - Worst: O(N)

  - Iterative Approach:
    - Average & Worst: O(1)

# Results
