# Algorithm Idea

The main idea is too traverse the tree and save the current's node depth. We can achieve this with BFS and DFS. The first solution is BFS and the next to are DFS in an iterative and recursive approach.

# Complexity

- Time: O(N) for all approaches.

- Space:O(d) for DFS and O(N) for BFS

# Results
