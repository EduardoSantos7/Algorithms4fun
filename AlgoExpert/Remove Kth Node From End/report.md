# Algorithm Idea

Approach 1)

Count the nodes in the list and then calculate how many node you should move from the beggining to the node before your target and then just swap pointers.

# Complexity

Approach 1)

- Time: O(n + (n - k - 1)) -> O(n)

- Space:O(1)

Approach 2)

- Time: O(n) -> O(n)

- Space:O(1)

# Results
