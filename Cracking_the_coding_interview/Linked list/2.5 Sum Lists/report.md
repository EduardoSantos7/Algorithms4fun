# Problem

You have 2 numbers represented by a linkked list, where each node contains a single digit. The digit are stored in reverse order, such that the 1's digit is at the head of the list. Wrrite a function that adds the 2 numbers and returnns the sum as a linked list. (You are not allowed to cheat and just convert the linked list to an integer)

# Algorithm Idea

Traverse the list and sum each digit and the carry.

# Complexity

- Time: O(N)

- Space:O(M) -> The digits in the new sum
