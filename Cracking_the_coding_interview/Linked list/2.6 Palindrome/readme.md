# Problem

Check if a linked list is a palindrome

# Algorithm Idea

Algorithm 1)

Reverse and compare the first half.

Algorithm 2)

Traverse and safe the first half in stack. Traverse the seconnd half comparing the current item with the top of the stack.

# Complexity

Algorithm 1)

- Time: O(N)

- Space:O(N)

Algorithm 2)

- Time: O(N)

- Space:O(N)
