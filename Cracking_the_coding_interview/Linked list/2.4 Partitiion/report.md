# Problem

Write code to partition a linked list around a value x, such that al nodes less than x come before all nodes greater than or equal to x.

# Algorithm Idea

Rearrange 2 linked list one for smaller values and other for greater values and join them.

# Complexity

- Time: O(N)

- Space:O(1)
